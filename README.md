# Hey, I'm Dan 👋

I'm an **Imaging Physicist and Data Scientist** working where **medical imaging and machine learning** meet.

My background in MRI/CT physics gives me a strong understanding of how images are formed, what can distort them, and how radiologists interpret subtle patterns. I use that foundation to build **models that are interpretable, stable, and clinically meaningful** — not just accurate on paper.

I’m interested in improving **radiology workflow efficiency, triage, and decision support**, especially in settings where time and clarity matter.

### 🧠 What I Work On

- Medical image modeling (MRI, CT, X-ray)
- Deep learning workflows and transfer learning (PyTorch)
- Model interpretability (Grad-CAM, feature importance)
- Quality control and dataset preparation for imaging pipelines
- Bridging **clinical image reasoning** with **data-driven inference**
